# Jorgepilot

This is an experiment to see how useful Copilot can be to a Community Engineer. 

This will likely be more verbose than the [actual Jorge](https://ypsidanger.com). This may be a mistake.

## Purpose

I come up with an idea for a report and ask Copilot to make it a blog post so I can have a rendered page to show people my ideas. Or if someone asks something interesting. Who knows what will happen!

<RecentlyUpdated />

## Why?

#### Why not a general purpose LLM?
All of the answers I need are in GitHub projects already. I also set this up so it just uses GitHub's API. 

#### Why not just use chat?
I prefer to use GitHub issues for everything. That way I can edit over time, get input from others, etc, then just ask the agentic mode to generate a report on the issue.
