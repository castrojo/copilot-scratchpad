# GitHub Copilot Onboarding

Get started with GitHub Copilot to enhance your coding productivity.

## What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool that helps you write code faster and with less effort. It suggests whole lines or blocks of code as you type.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A GitHub account
- Access to GitHub Copilot (through subscription or trial)
- A supported IDE or editor installed

## Installation

### Visual Studio Code

1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X or Cmd+Shift+X)
3. Search for "GitHub Copilot"
4. Click **Install**
5. Sign in with your GitHub account when prompted

### JetBrains IDEs

1. Open your JetBrains IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, etc.)
2. Go to Settings/Preferences → Plugins
3. Search for "GitHub Copilot"
4. Click **Install**
5. Restart your IDE
6. Sign in with your GitHub account when prompted

### Visual Studio

1. Open Visual Studio
2. Go to Extensions → Manage Extensions
3. Search for "GitHub Copilot"
4. Click **Download** and restart Visual Studio
5. Sign in with your GitHub account when prompted

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

Once installed, GitHub Copilot will automatically start suggesting code as you type:

1. **Inline Suggestions**: Start typing and Copilot will suggest completions
2. **Accept Suggestions**: Press `Tab` to accept a suggestion
3. **View Alternative Suggestions**: Press `Alt+]` or `Option+]` to cycle through alternatives
4. **Reject Suggestions**: Press `Esc` or continue typing to dismiss

### Writing Comments for Better Suggestions

GitHub Copilot works best when you provide clear comments describing what you want:

```javascript
// Function to calculate the factorial of a number
// [Copilot will suggest the implementation]
```

### Using Copilot Chat

GitHub Copilot Chat allows you to have a conversation with Copilot:

1. Open Copilot Chat panel (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Shift+I in VS Code)
2. Ask questions about your code
3. Request explanations or refactoring suggestions
4. Get help with debugging

## Best Practices

1. **Write Clear Comments**: Describe your intent in comments for better suggestions
2. **Review Suggestions**: Always review and test Copilot's suggestions
3. **Iterate**: If the first suggestion isn't right, try rephrasing your comment
4. **Use Context**: Copilot considers your entire file, so well-structured code helps
5. **Learn Patterns**: Pay attention to how Copilot interprets your requests

## Common Use Cases

### Writing Functions

```javascript
// Function to validate email address using regex
```

### Writing Tests

```javascript
// Unit test for the validateEmail function
```

### Writing Documentation

```javascript
/**
 * [Copilot can help generate JSDoc comments]
 */
```

## Troubleshooting

### Copilot Not Working

1. Check that you're signed in to GitHub
2. Verify your subscription is active
3. Restart your IDE
4. Check the Copilot status in the status bar

### Poor Suggestions

1. Add more context in comments
2. Ensure your code follows consistent patterns
3. Break complex tasks into smaller steps
