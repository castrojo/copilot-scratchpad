# Bluefin Project Health Check

## Executive Summary

[@ublue-os/bluefin](https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin) demonstrates strong project health with active daily development and automated dependency management. Analysis of October 2024-October 2025 shows 2,000 stars, 230 forks, and daily commit activity through both human contributors and Renovate bot automation.

## Overview

Bluefin provides a cloud-native desktop operating system built on Fedora Silverblue with GNOME. The project delivers atomic updates, container-first workflows, and declarative system management targeting developer workstations.

**Repository:** [@ublue-os/bluefin](https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin)  
**Created:** March 2023  
**Stars:** 2,000 (October 2025)  
**Forks:** 230  
**Open Issues:** 84

## Key Findings

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Commit Frequency | Daily | Mix of automated and manual |
| Issue Response | Active | Triage and labeling present |
| PR Merge Time | Variable | Maintainer approval required |
| Automated Updates | 60% | Renovate bot (ubot-7274) |
| Security Posture | Good | Codacy integration, Secure Boot |

## Analysis

### Governance

The project maintains 4 core maintainers defined in CODEOWNERS (@castrojo, @p5, @m2Giles, @tulilirockz). Decision-making follows GitHub PR workflow with maintainer approval. Apache 2.0 licensing with Universal Blue Community Guidelines provide governance framework.

### Community Activity

Daily commits include automated dependency updates via Renovate bot and manual contributions for features and fixes. Recent activity shows @castrojo leading cleanup and infrastructure work, with contributions from @EyeCantCU (developer tooling), @valerie-tar-gz (Bazaar additions), and others. Issue count of 84 appears manageable with active triage.

### Engineering Practices

GitHub Actions provides CI/CD with daily image builds across multiple streams (main, stable, gts). Build times average 30-45 minutes for full matrix. Container-first approach uses OCI images with OSTree-based atomic updates. Codacy integration shows Grade A code quality. Secure Boot support includes custom key with enrollment automation.

### Security

2FA requirements and branch protection are enabled. Container scanning and dependency updates address vulnerabilities. Clear vulnerability reporting process documented. Immutable filesystem with SELinux provides runtime hardening.

### Operational Maturity

Atomic updates with automatic rollback reduce risk. Multiple release streams support different user preferences. Automated ISO generation for installations. Documentation portal at docs.projectbluefin.io with community forum at community.projectbluefin.io.
