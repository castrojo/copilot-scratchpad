# CNCF Project Birthdays 2025

## Executive Summary
34 CNCF projects are celebrating their 5th birthday in 2025, having been accepted in 2020. No projects are celebrating their 10th birthday as the oldest CNCF projects date back to 2016. The 2020 cohort includes 3 graduated projects, 13 incubating projects, and 13 sandbox projects (with 5 now archived).

## Overview
This report identifies Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) projects that reach significant milestones in 2025, specifically their 5th and 10th anniversaries. The acceptance date into CNCF is used as the "birthday" reference point.

## Key Findings

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Projects celebrating 10 years (2015) | 0 | Oldest CNCF projects date to 2016 |
| Projects celebrating 5 years (2020) | 34 | Includes graduated, incubating, sandbox, and archived |
| Graduated (5-year) | 3 | Argo, KEDA, cert-manager |
| Incubating (5-year) | 13 | Strong cohort with several mature projects |
| Sandbox (5-year) | 13 | Many still active after 5 years |
| Archived (5-year) | 5 | Projects that have been archived |

## Projects Celebrating 5 Years (Accepted 2020)

### Graduated Projects

These three projects have successfully graduated from CNCF after their acceptance in 2020:

| Project | Accepted | Incubating | Graduated | Homepage |
|---------|----------|------------|-----------|----------|
| Argo | 2020-03-26 | 2020-03-26 | 2022-12-06 | <a href="https://argoproj.github.io/">argoproj.github.io</a> |
| KEDA | 2020-03-12 | 2021-08-18 | 2023-08-22 | <a href="https://keda.sh/">keda.sh</a> |
| cert-manager | 2020-11-10 | 2022-09-19 | 2024-09-29 | <a href="https://cert-manager.io/">cert-manager.io</a> |

**Analysis:** All three graduated projects moved through the CNCF maturity levels relatively quickly, with Argo achieving graduation in under 3 years. KEDA took ~3.5 years, and cert-manager completed the journey in just under 4 years. These projects demonstrate strong community adoption and production readiness.

### Incubating Projects

13 projects from the 2020 cohort are currently at incubating status:

| Crossplane | 2020-06-25 | 2021-09-14 | <a href="https://crossplane.io/">crossplane.io</a> |
| Kyverno | 2020-11-10 | 2022-07-13 | <a href="https://kyverno.io/">kyverno.io</a> |
| Litmus | 2020-06-25 | 2022-01-11 | <a href="https://litmuschaos.io/">litmuschaos.io</a> |
| Metal³ | 2020-09-08 | 2025-08-14 | <a href="https://metal3.io/">metal3.io</a> |
| OpenKruise | 2020-11-10 | 2023-03-02 | <a href="https://openkruise.io/">openkruise.io</a> |
| OpenYurt | 2020-09-08 | 2025-01-10 | <a href="https://openyurt.io/">openyurt.io</a> |
| Operator Framework | 2020-07-09 | 2020-07-09 | <a href="https://operatorframework.io/">operatorframework.io</a> |
| Volcano | 2020-04-09 | 2022-03-21 | <a href="https://volcano.sh/">volcano.sh</a> |

**Analysis:** Several standouts in this cohort include Crossplane (infrastructure as code), Backstage (developer portals), and Kyverno (Kubernetes policy management). Contour and Operator Framework moved to incubating status immediately upon acceptance, indicating they were already mature when joining CNCF.

### Sandbox Projects

13 projects remain at sandbox status after 5 years:

| k3s | 2020-08-19 | <a href="https://k3s.io">k3s.io</a> |

**Analysis:** Despite remaining at sandbox level, many of these projects (like k3s, Kuma, and Dex) have achieved significant adoption in production environments. The sandbox designation reflects their CNCF maturity level, not necessarily production readiness or adoption.

### Archived Projects

5 projects from 2020 have been archived:

| Project | Accepted | Homepage |
|---------|----------|----------|
| CNI-Genie | 2020-06-25 | <a href="https://cnigenie.netlify.app">cnigenie.netlify.app</a> |
| Keptn | 2020-06-25 | <a href="https://www.keptn.sh">keptn.sh</a> |
| Open Service Mesh | 2020-09-08 | <a href="https://openservicemesh.io/">openservicemesh.io</a> |
| Pravega | 2020-11-10 | <a href="https://cncf.pravega.io">pravega.io</a> |
| Service Mesh Interface (SMI) | 2020-03-19 | <a href="https://smi-spec.io">smi-spec.io</a> |

**Analysis:** Several service mesh-related projects have been archived as the ecosystem consolidated around other solutions. Keptn reached incubating status in 2022 before being archived.

## Analysis

The 2020 cohort represents a strong vintage for CNCF projects. With 3 graduated projects and 13 at incubating status after 5 years, this demonstrates healthy project maturation. The diversity of project types—from GitOps (Argo), autoscaling (KEDA), certificate management (cert-manager), to developer platforms (Backstage)—shows the breadth of cloud-native tooling that emerged during this period.

The archival of 5 projects (15% of the cohort) is a healthy sign of CNCF's project lifecycle management, pruning projects that haven't maintained momentum or where ecosystem consolidation has occurred.

## No 10-Year Milestone Projects

The CNCF was founded in 2015, with Kubernetes as the founding project. However, the formal project acceptance process began in 2016, meaning no projects are celebrating a 10th birthday in 2025. The oldest CNCF projects were accepted in 2016 and will celebrate their 10th anniversaries in 2026.
